# How to Contribute (WIP)
work in an editor that supports no forced line breaks (word wrap), otherwise you can't read the raw markdown table. VSCodium, Atom, Notepad++, Kate and others are suitable for raw markdown editing.

work in an editor that supports some sort of WYSIWYG like Obsidian or Typora otherwise it is a real mess to fill a markdown table. Typora can clean the final raw markdown table as well, and so can Obsidian with the Advanced Tables plugin.

To add a service it is always good to take the current version of the table to match the columns. I'll try to merge all PRs in a timely manner.
